# Unsupervised-Protein-Segmentation


How to visualize human proteome segments from Unsupervised Protein Segmentation using Colab:

1. go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 
    you may need to log in to your google account
2. from the "open notebook" menu select "GitHub"
3. enter github URL: "moses-lab/Unsupervised-Protein-Segmentation/"
4. click on the notebook "/Unsupervised-Protein-Segmentation/human_proteome_segments_colab.ipynb"
5. run each block of code by clicking on the top left hand corner "play" button
6. run the top block of code first
7. run the second block of code to generate the figure. On the top right corner of the figure there is an interactive menu where you can download a .png of the figure directly to your computer
8. run the third block of code to save an interactive .html of the figure to colab 
9. click on the fild folder icon on the left to access your html file then download it to your desktop. html files generated in this colab session will be deleted from colab when the window is closed
10. re-run the second and third block of code to generate new figures and new html files
